# sengal-psycho
A breakout clone in javascript

## Notes

* Used basic shapes for Game props

	Used rectangle for bricks and paddle. And used circle for ball

* Used simple physics for collision detection

	Used the coordinates of the centre of the ball and the ball's radius to detect the world bounds.
	Used the coordinates of the centre of the ball to check if the centre is within the bounds of the rectangle (paddle & brick) to detect collistion

* Used a scoring system to provide scores for the player
* Used a lives system to liven up the game play and to detect when the game is over.
